        <h2 class="section-title">Technofeudalism: <span class="section-number">1</span></h2>
        
        <p>Technofeudalism is a system in which large tech companies hold a vast majority of power and retain control and influence over their users and customers. This term originates from historical feudalism, a system where kings, at the top of the feudal hierarchy, owned all the land and granted portions of it to members of society in exchange for military loyalty or service. The nobles who received land would, in turn, distribute portions to lower-ranking participants like serfs, in exchange for services like protection.</p>

        <p>This power was decentralized in the sense that once the king distributed land, he no longer controlled it directly. The recipients of land could continue this process, ensuring that every class of society had a role, and the system worked smoothly through subjective value exchanges. The downfall of feudalism was driven by the introduction of coinage—physical currency became a means of wealth accumulation, replacing land. This allowed for private wealth accumulation, creating a system where individuals were no longer dependent on land controlled by higher classes, leading to more transactional freedom.</p>

        <p>Today, we see an oligopoly of major tech companies like Google, Meta, and TikTok. These companies consolidate their power by making us dependent on their platforms and payment gateways for communication, social validation, and commerce. They turn our usage into data, which they sell to third parties for profit, leaving us with little control over how that data is handled. Additionally, users on these platforms don't own anything, including the means of production. The only ownership claim users have is their username, which isn't truly theirs—it can be taken away by the platform if deemed necessary. In a way, this mirrors the relationship between kings and land ownership, with platforms controlling usernames in a similar way. Ultimately, users are not owners or producers—they are merely participants. While users can generate attention and monetize it, they remain bound to the role of "user."</p>

        <p>Finally, we are all subject to the algorithm. Your content won't be seen unless it adheres to the platform's criteria, and the algorithm can change at any moment, potentially disrupting your content's reach. Interestingly enough, cryptocurrency has the potential to become the same catalyst that coinage once was. Cryptocurrency operates as an open, decentralized ledger, allowing participation from anyone with basic internet access, regardless of background or currency. Its peer-to-peer nature removes intermediaries, making transactions and tasks frictionless. The adoption of cryptocurrency will bring challenges, and I'm sure cybercrime will rise at a linear rate to the rate of adoption of cryptocurrency. Although it will also create new sectors and job opportunities as individuals develop ways to protect and manage this open ledger—much like how nobles once hired serfs to protect their land, the cycle begins anew.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">The nature of non-linear returns and utilization of leverage: <span class="section-number">2</span></h2>
        
        <p>Contrary to human evolution, today we live in a day and age where returns are no longer 1:1. I will write about the power we have to utilize leverage in the following forms. Labor, capital, and media/code. To briefly break down these forms of leverage and what I find their characteristics to be:</p>

        <p><strong>Labor:</strong> Other humans working for you, used in the older world, not as valuable now. Includes the hierarchy/status game and some ego. Allows for human error and emotion. Moves slowly in comparison to other forms of leverage and is based on permission. To have someone work for you they need to willingly follow you, and you need to expend energy to bridge the gap of communication. (Juxtaposed to code where it is permission-less and autonomous)</p>

        <p><strong>Capital:</strong> Money, relatively new as it's only been around for a few thousand years. Based on permission. You need to be given capital by intellectual or performance-based prowess or have the capital yourself. E.g. Capital used to invest or build a product/service.</p>

        <p><strong>Media/code:</strong> To me, this is the highest form of leverage we have currently, you can create products with little to no marginal cost of replication, it is entirely permission-less, it is errorless, emotionless, it is extremely cheap, and it works for you 24/7. E.g I create a podcast and post it online rather than going from speaker event to speaker event to deliver the same information. The podcast has no cost of replication whereas quite obviously going from speaker event to speaker event would cost a solid amount of time. The podcast cost me only the time it took to create it and the information can be delivered an infinite amount of times at essentially any place in the world without the demanding of my physical presence.</p>

        <p>The idea of media and code is very egalitarian in nature by allowing permission-less and extremely cheap access to this form of leverage. The result of this is only a small % of individuals succeeding in using this form of leverage it is only because:</p>
        <p>1. They couldn't demand enough attention and then convert that attention into clicks, orders, subscribers, etc.</p>
        <p>2. They are not seen as useful or fit the marketplace. Or whatever space they were trying to get into.</p>

        <p>Media and code allow you to have a cheap errorless workforce that runs 24/7. Combine this with a product or service that has no marginal cost of replication and enough attention for results, scalability, and success.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Leaving the rat race, to become a rat in your own race: <span class="section-number">3</span></h2>
        
        <p>People cling to this popularized idea of "the rat race" and lean their whole belief system and efforts to escape the rat race, only to find they've become a rat in their own race. In simple terms, if you are working 40 hours a week at a job that you don't like, and you leave that job to work another job you equally dislike in which you are self-employed. On paper, you have left the rat race, but in reality you have just swapped one thing for another. You've just become a rat in your own race. The real goal shouldn't be to leave the "rat race", but leave the race entirely. Is everyone capable of doing this? No. Because society needs workers to stabilize the economy and do things that keep the economic machine's gears turning. I want to be clear in saying that I do not think involvement in the "rat race" is a bad thing or working a 9–5 is inherently bad. It is only bad if you personally do not like that way of life.</p>

        <p>The only real way to leave this race is to cut every point of connection you have with it and, with that, you have no need to participate in it. The issue is that people need money, and in the majority of cases don't have enough of it and won't have enough, especially if they leave their jobs that they dislike. A large issue is that once people enter into the "rat race", they take on responsibilities like a mortgage, a wife, kids, friendships, and co-worker relationships. These responsibilities they take on ground them and in turn leave their personal and financial responsibilities in turmoil if they ever try to leave this race. I am also not saying that responsibility is a bad thing, I think it holds people accountable. The issue here is that people don't look far enough into the future to determine this change in their ideal life and once they are faced with reality they feel trapped and have things like a midlife crisis.</p>

        <p>We have entered into a time period where the quote "whatever a man sows, this he will also reap." (In this example only pertaining to work & monetary return) is no longer true. Input ≠ Output. Busy ≠ Productive.</p>

        <p>Money, by definition, is just a means of exchange. Give the marketplace something it needs, doesn't know how to get, or give it something it needs in a way that's more efficient or more so, in the path of least resistance, and you will be compensated for it if your systems are set up properly. If you don't want to play this game at all, then start by defining what you really want. A lot of people want to be multi-millionaires just because everyone wants to be one. They don't even know why they want to be one. Whether that be comfort, freedom, the proving of their own self-worth, ego, social hierarchical games, or other reasons they actually want to be a multi-millionaire for. I think if you can get to the root of your desires, you can learn a lot and can be given clues on how you should be living your life.</p>

        <p class="quote-text">"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?" Mark 8:36</p>

        <p>Modern money does not obey the laws of physics. Output created by means of no input, aka. Printing money out of thin air. Although you can displace this cash and convert it to essentially any currency, or commodity, it still does not obey the laws of physics. Something odd to think about is that even Cryptocurrency acts in accordance with this law of physics by way of real energy to host and run its vast systems and computations. I am not a huge crypto believer, I rather hold the dollar. Although I'm sure in the future there will be a mass adoption and bigger and bigger companies/entities will start to transact with cryptocurrency and along with the mass adoption crime will rise at a linear rate.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Human Desire and Hedonic Adaptation/Acclimation: <span class="section-number">4</span></h2>
        
        <p>All the fun truly lies in the wanting rather than in the having. In most instances, once you obtain something you've desired, it either turns out to be a letdown or, at least, you experience a peak emotional state that, as time passes, becomes fleeting. This cycle prompts you to return to square one, chasing another desire, fulfilling it, losing the excitement, and finding yourself once again at the trailhead of desire. That's not to say you shouldn't desire things at all; desiring things can be fun and exciting. However, at a minimum, you should desire the right things by understanding why you desire these items, what they truly bring to you, and what purpose they serve. If you fail to do this, you will face disappointment and realize that the energy expenditure you've conducted to materialize that thing was not worth it once it's all said and done.</p>

        <p>Not being clear on why you want something creates fertile ground for your mind to attribute excessive importance to it, which ultimately will cloud your perception of the desire until you see it for what it really is once you have it. I believe people often have a hyperfixation on things they don't truly want due to a desire to be perceived in a way they're not and the excessive importance they've attributed to the possession of that thing. I contend that if the world were blind, people would care far less about material possessions and social hierarchical status. At the end of the day, you can accumulate wealth and possessions, but you need to ensure you really want them, or you'll reach the end and realize you've blundered. Then, all your chips get pushed back to the middle of the table. What do you really want versus what does cult-ure lead you to believe you want?</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Disjoining the relationship between time and money: <span class="section-number">5</span></h2>
        
        <p class="quote-text">"A puppet is free as long as he loves his strings" - Sam Harris</p>

        <p>Ideology on wealth pertaining to time, energy, and money preservation - (definition) wealth: an abundance of valuable possessions or money. Contrary to popular belief, wealth is not solely about money, nor has it ever been. I think people often associate wealth closely with money because the words "rich" and "wealth" are used interchangeably. However, the reality is that being rich is defined as possessing a great deal of money, whereas wealth, as defined, signifies an abundance of valuable possessions or money. Therefore, using "rich" interchangeably isn't necessarily incorrect, but it is partially incorrect. "Rich" primarily accounts for monetary value, while "valuable possessions" encompass much more and are subjective in nature.</p>

        <p>The reason I take the time to explain the two is that you can be rich in money but poor in valuable possessions like time, or you can be truly wealthy, obtaining an abundance of both time and money. You shouldn't care about being rich, you should care about being wealthy. The way to achieve this is to sever the relationship between time and money. Instead of trading time for money, you spend your time building systems that generate money on their own. The only gap to bridge is the lack of understanding of how to make money without expending energy or trading your time for it.</p>

        <p>If you're confused about what I mean by building systems, it could involve investing your assets so they compound, building a business that runs on its own (digital products, for example, which is my favorite), or building a business yourself and then hiring out/delegating everything. By no means am I suggesting this is easy, but it is possible. Even if it is difficult, consider that no matter what you do, you're going to work hard. So why not work smart as well and utilize leverage to start winning your time back. You need to stop expending your time and energy for dollars. Expend your time and energy in systems and functions that intercept the flow of money transactionally and in turn yield you dollars after the operation costs are paid.</p>

        <p class="quote-text">"If there were one who lived wholly without the use of money, the State itself would hesitate to demand it of him. But the rich man — not to make any invidious comparison — is always sold to the institution which makes him rich…. Thus his moral ground is taken from under his feet." - Henry David Thoreau</p>

        <p><strong>The natural axis of happiness and time.</strong></p>

        <p>Even though I just wrote all about buying back your time and freedom with the substitution of means for making money, I don't believe that obtaining wealth in time equates to happiness. Interestingly enough, achieving success too early, seemingly with ease, having excessive free time, or being extremely passionate about your endeavors, followed by retirement, can lead to feelings of unhappiness or a sense that something is missing from your life.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Neural pathways, thought patterns, and compartmentalization: <span class="section-number">7</span></h2>
        
        <p>Neural pathway: is the connection formed by axons that project from neurons to make synapses onto neurons in another location, to enable neurotransmission (the sending of a signal from one region of the nervous system to another). In this text, I'm gonna write about how to use your neural pathways (pertaining to your thoughts and thoughts alone) and how understanding the anatomical nature of neural pathways will aid you in life.</p>

        <p>With neural pathways, you can have a very strong pathway, or a weak one. The more you exercise a pathway, the stronger it gets, let me break it down like so. Imagine you are sledding, and you have just created a new path. The first few times you go down that new path, you'll be slow and might not make it all the way down. Though, the more you go down that path, the easier it gets, and it gets better defined and molded by your sled, and in turn, you'll be quicker and quicker every time you go down it.</p>

        <p>This is the same for your neural pathways (thoughts). If you think a thought 1,000 times, you arrive at the same conclusion or emotional state almost immediately due to the repetition of thought. Consequently, every time you think of a thought, the easier it gets to think it, and the path to that thought gets less resistant every time. This is where you have to be careful. If you're thinking positive thoughts all the time, then it's no problem, of course. Though, if you're thinking negative thoughts, then doing this will result in you getting stuck in negative loop(s) and hence creating a negative life or experience for yourself.</p>

        <p><strong>Compartmentalization:</strong> noun 1. the division of something into sections or categories.</p>

        <p>Compartmentalization is more advanced than what I've just written about, but it's close enough to the topic to mention it if you want to learn it outside of this text. Mental compartmentalization is simply sectioning off thoughts for different occasions or experiences. This helps you change your state to mold to every scenario you find yourself in. Napoleon allegedly was really good at this. Here's a quote from him:</p>

        <p class="quote-text">"Different subjects and different affairs are arranged in my head as in a cupboard. When I wish to interrupt one train of thought, I shut that drawer and open another. Do I wish to sleep? I simply close all the drawers, and there I am — asleep." Napoleon: A Life, Andrew Roberts</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">The Slingshot: <span class="section-number">17</span></h2>
        
        <p>The slingshot is a strategy to access an alternative and superior path for you to embark on and experience. This strategy shares ingredients and core elements of monasticism and asceticism, depositing productivity in the direction of your goals and mitigating any and all neutralizing or entropic actions or effects. This translates to all focus work/dedicated hours and energy toward this goal or ambition with singleness of purpose.</p>

        <p>To paint out the strategy in action: when you focus your attention exclusively on actions that move you in the direction of the attainment of your goal, you are, in essence, pulling your slingshot back. What does it mean to "let go" of your slingshot? Letting go means indulging in those things that you know do not contribute to the achievement of your goal—i.e., having a glass of wine, skipping a focus work session, haphazardly doing a task, having a cheat meal, partying, taking unnecessary breaks, etc.—or indulging in the rewards of your hard work or the fruits of your labor.</p>

        <p>When you let go of the slingshot, you will be propelled to the exact destination in proportion to the force you've used to pull the slingshot back. The more you pull your slingshot back, the further you'll go—and when you let go, you reset the hard work and dedicated energy you've accumulated over that period of time. The further your slingshot is pulled back, the more tension and strength is required to keep pulling it back. Do not give in to the release of the slingshot for any reason other than the fact that you have already attained the goal.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Distraction: <span class="section-number">19</span></h2>
        
        <p>We live in a world where distractions are virtually everywhere. Adopt this lens, go somewhere (physically, or pull out your phone), and observe—you'll find that everything is pulling your attention away from you. Recognize that many people always have something playing: when they go for a walk, they have music or a podcast on; in the gym, they listen to music; before going to bed, they watch videos; and when they wake up, they go on their phone. This constantly mutes your own thoughts and plugs in external indoctrination or noise, whether it's directed consciously or not.</p>

        <p>We have lost much of our introspection and self-awareness due to this new paradigm that feeds economically and monetarily on your attention, which you accept. The cycle begins as follows: content is produced and algorithmically designed for consumption by an audience. This audience then willfully consumes that content and unknowingly energizes it by giving it what it needs in the form of viewership and engagement.</p>

        <p>The reason why this is a problem is that it takes people's personal time, attention, and energy away from themselves. While an equilibrium of media consumption could be reached, nowadays it is not. You could name a million ways people can better themselves or at least avoid entropy by limiting distractions: they can spend this time thinking about their own goals and aspirations, plan out what they want to do with their life in the near or distant future (and how to do so), or reflect on their own character and daily experiences to improve for the next day.</p>

        <p>Human beings are hardwired to release endorphins after rigorous work, and once you put in that effort, you'll feel those endorphins for an extended period of time—far longer than the manufactured endorphins you get from media. Why do you think you accidentally open apps on your phone and start scrolling, or find yourself scrolling without realizing? Your brain is searching for some dopamine. Self-censor, and do not accept fake rewards.</p>
